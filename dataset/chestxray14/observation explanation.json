    "atelectasis": "It is the collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. Findings can include lung opacification and loss of lung volume.",
    "cardiomegaly": "Cardiomegaly (sometimes megacardia or megalocardia) is a medical condition in which the heart is enlarged. ",
    "effusion": "A pleural effusion is accumulation of excessive fluid in the pleural space, the potential space that surrounds each lung. A pleural effusion infiltrates the space between the visceral pleura and the parietal pleura",
    "infiltrate": "A pulmonary infiltrate is a substance denser than air, such as pus, blood, or protein, which lingers within the parenchyma of the lungs. Pulmonary infiltrates are associated with pneumonia, tuberculosis and sarcoidosis.",
    "mass": "A lung mass is an abnormal growth or area in the lungs and it can also view as lung cancer.",
    "nodule": "A lung nodule or pulmonary nodule is a relatively small focal density in the lung. it may be confused with the projection of a structure of the chest wall or skin, such as a nipple, a healing rib fracture or  lung cancer.",
    "pneumonia": "Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung primarily affecting the small air sacs known as alveoli.  Pneumonia may present with opacities. Complications such as pleural effusion may also be found increasing the diagnostic accuracy of lung consolidation and pleural effusion",
    "pneumothorax": "A pneumothorax is seen as a region of lucency (dark) around the edge of the lung. This is difficult to see because the lung itself is black too. They are more easily seen on erect chest x-rays as the free air typically rises up to the apex above the lung, making it more visible.\nTips to help to find pneumothoraces include:\nthe lung edge:you should not be able to see the lung edge,if you can, the region peripherally is likely a pneumothorax. \nabsence of vessels: the lung should have vessels running through it, these are white branching structures on the x-ray. if there are not vessels, there may be a pneumothorax.\nIf both these findings occur, measure how deep the pneumothorax is and check whether there is any mediastinal shift.\nPneumothorax on supine or portable chest x-rays can be much more subtle unless they are very large, as the free air rises to the front of the chest with the lung behind it, so there is less likely to be an obvious gap between the lung and chest wall.",
    "consolidation": "it is a region of normally compressible lung tissue that has filled with liquid instead of air. Consolidation must be present to diagnose pneumonia: the signs of lobar pneumonia are characteristic and clinically referred to as consolidation.",
    "edema": "Pulmonary edema, also known as pulmonary congestion, is excessive liquid accumulation in the tissue and air spaces of the lungs. It will show fluid in the alveolar walls",
    "emphysema": "Emphysema, or pulmonary emphysema, is a lower respiratory tract disease, characterized by air-filled spaces (pneumatosis) in the lungs, that can vary in size and may be very large",
    "tail_abnorm_obs": "Some very rare diseases.",
    "thicken": "Pleural thickening is an increase in the bulkiness of one or both of the pulmonary pleurae. It may cause by pulmonary Infection, empyema, tuberculosis or lung cancer.",
    "hernia": "Lung hernia (Sibson hernia) is a protrusion of lung outside of thoracic wall. the hernia is noted after chest trauma, thoracic surgery or certain pulmonary diseases"
